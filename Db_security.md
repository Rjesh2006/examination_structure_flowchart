## 🔐 2. Security Design

### Network Isolation
- Database is placed inside a private Azure Virtual Network (VNet).
- Private Endpoint ensures no public internet exposure.
- Only application servers and approved admin IPs can access the database.

### Firewall & Access Control
- Network Security Groups (NSGs) restrict traffic to PostgreSQL port (5432).
- Server-level firewall rules allow access only from trusted IP ranges.

### Identity Management
- Azure Active Directory (AD) used for authentication.
- Managed identities assigned to applications for secure, token-based access.

### Encryption
- **At Rest**: Data encrypted using customer-managed keys in Azure Key Vault.
- **In Transit**: SSL/TLS enforced for all connections.
- **Column-Level**: Sensitive fields encrypted using Always Encrypted.

## 🧠 3. Operational Features

### Credential Management
- Secrets like passwords and connection strings stored in Azure Key Vault.
- Applications retrieve credentials securely using managed identities.

### Monitoring & Alerts
- Azure Defender enabled for threat detection.
- Alerts configured for high CPU usage and suspicious activity.
- Custom views track active connections and user behavior.

### Backup & Disaster Recovery
- Backups are geo-redundant and support point-in-time restore.
- Backup integrity verified monthly.

## 📉 4. Data Lifecycle Management

### Archiving Graduated Students
- Student records older than 10 years are moved to an archive table.
- Keeps the main database lean and improves performance.
- Archival and deletion are done in a safe, transactional manner.

---

## 💰 5. Cost Optimization

### Reserved Capacity
- Reserved instances purchased for 1–3 years to save up to 60% on compute costs.

### Auto-Scaling
- Database automatically scales between 4 and 16 vCores based on usage.
- Security settings like encryption, firewall rules, and backup schedules are preserved during scaling.

---

## 📆 6. Monthly Security Maintenance

A scheduled script performs the following tasks:
- Reviews access logs for authentication events
- Checks for pending security updates
- Verifies backup integrity and retention
- Audits firewall rules for unauthorized changes
- Monitors Key Vault access for anomalies
